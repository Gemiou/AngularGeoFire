GeoFire stores data redundantly so you'll want to keep the objects you store with it (via $insertByLocWithId method) down to a minimum, preferrably just the id and then you'd use AngularFire to perform a look-up of the object's data using the id queried with GeoFire.\r\n\r\n````\r\n<script src=\"//cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"bower_components/angularfire/angularfire.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"bower_components/geoFire/geoFire.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"bower_components/AngularGeoFire/dist/angularGeoFire.js\"></script>\r\n````\r\n\r\nInclude angularGeoFire.min.js and then include it in your app dependency. The API matches that of geoFire @ https://github.com/firebase/geoFire, just prefix the method calls with a $ (ex: $geoFire.$getPointsNearLoc). AngularGeoFire returns promises vs geoFire's passing of callbacks, with the exception of the $onPointsNearXX and $offPointsNearXX methods which accept a broadcast name and will broadcast the data from geoFire using the broadcast name passed in.\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\nangular.module('yourApp', ['angularGeoFire']);\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen you can reference the dependency in your services or controllers\r\n\r\n````javascript\r\n\r\nangular.module('yourApp')\r\n  .controller('SomeCtrl', function($scope, $geofire, $log) {\r\n    $scope.myPoints = [];\r\n    \r\n    var geo = $geofire(new Firebase('https://<<your-firebase>>.firebaseio.com/'));\r\n    var someObj = { id: \"some-key\", make: \"Tesla\" };\r\n    // Trivial example of inserting some data and querying data\r\n    geo.$insertByLocWithId([37.771393,-122.447104], someObj.id, someObj).catch(function(err) { $log.error(err); });\r\n    // Query for data\r\n    geo.$getPointsNearLoc([37.771393,-122.447104],5)\r\n          .then(function(array) {\r\n            $scope.myPoints = array;\r\n          });\r\n  });\r\n  \r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
